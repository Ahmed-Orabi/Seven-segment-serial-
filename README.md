# Arduino Seven Segment Display Controller

This is a simple Arduino project that allows you to control a seven segment display using the serial monitor or a connected device through the UART port. The code is written in C++ and can be easily modified to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you will need the following:

- An Arduino board (such as the Uno or Nano)
- A seven segment display
- Jumper wires
- A computer with the Arduino IDE installed

### Installing

1. Connect the seven segment display to the Arduino board. Refer to the schematic in the "schematic.png" file for the pinout.

2. Open the "SevenSegmentDisplayController.ino" file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.

2. Type a number between 0 and 9999 in the serial monitor and press enter. The seven segment display will display the corresponding number.

3. Alternatively, you can send a number from a connected device through the UART port. The Arduino board will read the number and display it on the seven segment display.

## Modifying the Code

The code is well-commented and easy to understand, so you can modify it to suit your needs. For example, you can change the number of digits on the seven segment display, or add additional functionality.
